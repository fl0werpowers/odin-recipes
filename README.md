# Odin Recipes Assignment

*This assignment is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.*

## Contents

A plain HTML recipe book website containing recipes for some of my favorite dishes.

Recipes included:

- Fettuccine Alfredo
- Scrambled eggs
- Butter Chicken

## Studying subjects covered

Everything covered in the HTML Foundations section of the Foundations course. In practice this covers all the necessary basics required to build a web page from scratch. 

This may be revisited in the future to add the styled elements.
