        <li>2 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 green cardamoms</li>
        <li>4 cloves</li>

        <li>1/2nd tablespoon kasuri methi crushed</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h3>Marinate the chicken</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make sure there is no excess moisture on chicken. Pat dry with kitchen tissues/paper if needed. Add red
            chili powder, salt and lemon juice. Mix will, cover and rest for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add ginger garlic paste, garam masala, cumin powder, coriander powder, kasuri methi, turmeric and hung
            curd/Greek yogurt. Mix well and cover. Let the chicken rest in the marinade for a minimum of 12 hours in the
            refrigerator. The longer you leave, the more tender and juicer the chicken is going to be. You can leave
            this for a maximum of 48 hours.</li>
        <li>When you are ready to make the sauce, prepare the ingredients. Keep the chicken out of the refrigerator, as
            we don’t want to grill/ pan-fry the cold chicken.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare the sauce</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Blend 600 grams diced tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Blend 20 to 22 cashew nuts, add water, blend again.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a pan. Add cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms. Once they begin to sizzle, add
            ginger garlic paste, green chilies (leave out for kids) and fry on a medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes till the
            raw smell goes away. Do not burn.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat. Stir in the red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder and coriander powder.</li>
        <li>Strain the tomato puree to the pan. Use a sturdy spoon to strain and discard the residue.
        </li>
        <li>Mix well and bring this to a boil on a medium high heat. Be careful as this can easily splatter.</li>
        <li>Cover partially and let boil on a medium heat, stirring often, until thick. This takes about 15 mins,
            depending on the kind of cookware and stove.</li>
        <li>Pour 1 and 1/2nd cups hot water and mix well.</li>
        <li>Simmer, partially covered for 10 mins or until the sauce thickens & traces of fats/butter are visible on top
            of the sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare the chicken</h3>

    <p>Chicken can be prepared in the oven or grilled on the stove top. In this recipe the chicken is going to be
        pan-fried.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Add one tablespoon oil/butter or ghee and place the chicken pieces spacing them apart. Fry on a medium heat
            for 2 mins. Ignore the moisture oozing out of the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces to the other side, don’t
            burn and do not overcook.</li>
        <li>Cook until the chicken is just done and all the moisture evaporates.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Make Chicken Makhani</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Add chicken to the prepared butter chicken gravy.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2nd cup more hot water if the sauce is too thick and simmer for about 5 to 7 minutes till it becomes
            tender. This is the time the sauce actually develops the flavors. The cook time may vary here. This
            additional half cup water is optional depending on how long you cook.</li>
        <li>Add 1/2nd to 3/4th teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 1/2nd tablespoon kasuri methi. Stir well and taste
            test. If needed, add more garam masala and another tablespoon butter for additional flavor.</li>
        <li>Stir in 1/4th to 1/3rd cup heavy cream. Or take a few tablespoons of the hot gravy to a small bowl and stir
            in the
            cream. Mix and then pour the cream to the butter chicken. This prevents cream from splitting.</li>
    </ol>
