    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fettuccine Alfredo, also known as the indulgent "fettuccine al burro," is a luscious Italian pasta masterpiece.
        This dish features fresh, wide ribbons of fettuccine luxuriously entwined with velvety butter and lavish
        Parmesan (known in Italy as "pasta al burro e parmigiano"). As the Parmesan gracefully melds into a creamy
        cascade, it orchestrates a masterpiece of flavors that cocoon the pasta in a sumptuous and opulent cheese sauce.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>250g <em>fettuccine</em> pasta</li>
        <li>150g butter</li>
        <li>150g Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano grated cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Boil water in the pot. Add salt and throw in fettuccine once the water boils.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta for 1-2 minutes, stirring it.</li>
        <li>While pasta is being cooked, carve butter into small pieces and melt it on the frying pan at medium heat. Be
            careful not to burn it!</li>
        <li>Pour 3-4 tablespoons of water from the pot to make the sauce denser and creamier.</li>
        <li>When pasta is cooked <i>al dente</i>, filter out the water, leaving a couple of spoons.</li>
        <li>Put the pasta on the frying pan and stir.</li>
        <li>After stirring, turn off the heat, add grated cheese and the remaining water, then stir. If the sauce ends
            up too dry, add extra 2-3 tablespoons of water.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
