    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Scrambled eggs, the humble yet tantalizing creation of the breakfast world, are a symphony of simplicity and
        savoriness. Whisked to a velvety perfection, these golden ribbons of sunshine come to life in a sizzling pan,
        where they pirouette in buttery splendor. With each gentle stir, they transform into delicate, curd-like clouds
        of deliciousness, their custardy texture and creamy richness a delight to behold. Seasoned with a pinch of salt,
        a dash of pepper, and perhaps a hint of chives or a sprinkle of cheese, they dance on the palate, a harmonious
        melody of comfort and warmth, embodying breakfast bliss.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 large free range eggs</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons single cream or full cream milk</li>
        <li>a knob of butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the
            mixture has just one consistency.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow
            the butter to brown or it will discolor the eggs.</li>
        <li>Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting
            and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.</li>
        <li>Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a
            moment to finish cooking.
        </li>
        <li>Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.
        </li>
    </ol>
